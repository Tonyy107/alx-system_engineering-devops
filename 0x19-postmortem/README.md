# Postmortem: Web Application Outage Due to Database Connection Failure

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** August 14, 2024, 03:00 AM - 05:30 AM UTC

**Impact:** The web application experienced a total outage, with users unable to access any services during this period. Approximately 100% of users were affected, resulting in complete downtime for all frontend and backend services.

**Root Cause:** The root cause was a misconfigured database connection pool, which exhausted all available connections due to a sudden spike in user traffic, leading to failed database queries and application crashes.

## Timeline

- **03:00 AM:** Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating a sharp increase in database query failures.
- **03:05 AM:** On-call engineer confirmed the issue after receiving the alert and noticed the web application was down.
- **03:10 AM:** Initial investigation focused on the web server configuration, suspecting a potential memory leak or server overload.
- **03:30 AM:** Misleading path: Engineers restarted the web servers, but the issue persisted, leading to further delays in resolution.
- **04:00 AM:** Escalation to the database engineering team after realizing the issue might be related to the database layer.
- **04:15 AM:** The database team identified the exhausted connection pool as the probable cause.
- **04:30 AM:** Engineers adjusted the connection pool settings and restarted the database service.
- **04:45 AM:** The web application started recovering as database connections were re-established.
- **05:00 AM:** Full recovery of all services confirmed through monitoring tools.
- **05:30 AM:** Post-incident review initiated to identify root cause and preventative measures.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The primary cause of the outage was an improperly configured database connection pool. During a routine update to the application’s configuration, the maximum number of database connections was inadvertently set too low. When a surge in user traffic occurred, the limited connections were quickly exhausted, causing the application to fail when it couldn’t establish new connections to the database. The web servers continued to send requests, which repeatedly failed, leading to complete service unavailability.

**Resolution:** Once the exhausted connection pool was identified as the root cause, the database team increased the maximum number of allowed connections in the pool configuration. The database service was restarted to apply the new settings, and the web application was monitored to ensure connections were being properly managed. After the adjustments, the application began processing requests normally, and full service was restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements Needed:**
- **Database Connection Pool Configuration:** Implement stricter review processes for configuration changes to ensure critical parameters, such as connection pool sizes, are correctly set.
- **Monitoring Enhancements:** Enhance monitoring to include alerts specifically for database connection pool usage to detect potential exhaustion early.
- **Traffic Handling:** Implement autoscaling mechanisms for both web servers and database connections to handle sudden traffic spikes more effectively.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Patch Database Configuration:** Update the database connection pool settings across all environments to ensure they can handle peak traffic loads.
- [ ] **Add Monitoring:** Implement detailed monitoring and alerting for database connection pool metrics, such as connection usage and wait times.
- [ ] **Conduct a Review:** Perform a thorough review of recent configuration changes to identify other potential misconfigurations.
- [ ] **Deploy Autoscaling:** Implement autoscaling for web servers and database connections to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic demands.
- [ ] **Run Load Tests:** Conduct regular load testing to simulate traffic spikes and ensure the system can handle high loads without exhausting resources.
